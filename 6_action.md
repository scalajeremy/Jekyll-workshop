# 6. Action

Let's play around a litte bit.

## Build your website

If it's not yet build

```bash
    jekyll serve
```

## Add some posts

Take a look to the **_posts** folder. There is a file that should look like that "*2019-06-24-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown*". This is a post, a news, an entry to your blog.
By default, Jekyll will show them to your homepage by date order.
For now, we'll just learn to make a new entry.

Open your favorite text/code editor and create a new file "**2019-06-25-workshop.md**"
