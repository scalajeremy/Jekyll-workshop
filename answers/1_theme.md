# Where is the theme files?

If you run this command, it will show you where the theme is downloaded.

```bash
bundle show minima
```

You can now open it with this command. You just need to copy the folders inside and  paste them in your project.
> :heavy_exclamation_mark: Don't cut the files and folder you'll find, or other website you've created with Jekyll could not work properly anymore.

```bash
# On Linux
xdg-open $(bundle show minima)
# On MacOS
open $(bundle show minima)
```

Not that hard, isn't it?
