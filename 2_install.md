# 2. Installation of Jekyll

Now that we setup your environnement we're gonna install Jekyll

You can do it, again, by following the official [doc here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs) or these quick steps:

## Linux

### Get Jekyll, Bundler and Gems

```bash
gem install jekyll bundler
```

## MacOS

Normally you already installed it if you followed the previous page. In case not, [here is the link](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/#install-jekyll)
